## Functionalities
The HR Analytics Dashboard, created using Power BI, offers a detailed and interactive view of employee attrition within the company. This dashboard is designed to help HR professionals and management understand the reasons behind employee turnover, identify trends, and develop strategies to improve employee retention.

## Key Features:

* Attrition Overview: A high-level summary of overall attrition rates, showing the percentage of employees leaving the company over specific time periods. This section provides a quick snapshot of the turnover situation.

* Attrition by Department: Visual breakdown of attrition rates by different departments or teams within the company. This helps in identifying departments with higher turnover rates and areas needing attention.

* Reasons for Attrition: Detailed analysis of the various reasons for employee departures, such as compensation issues, lack of career growth, work-life balance, management practices, and more. This section includes visualizations like pie charts and bar graphs for clear representation.

* Demographic Analysis: Insights into attrition rates based on employee demographics, including age, gender, tenure, and job role. This helps in understanding if certain demographic groups are more prone to leaving the company.

* Attrition Trends Over Time: Time-series analysis showing how attrition rates and reasons have changed over months or years. This helps in spotting patterns and assessing the impact of any HR interventions or company changes.

* Interactive Filters and Drill-downs: Users can filter data by various dimensions such as department, job role, and time period. Interactive drill-downs allow for deeper exploration into specific attrition cases or trends.
